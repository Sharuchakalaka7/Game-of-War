The Game of War Rules...

* There are 52 playing Cards in the Deck, 13 Cards per suit, 4 suits, no jokers. The order of the Card values from lowest to highest goes like this: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, (J)ack, (Q)ueen, (K)ing, (A)ce. This Deck is shuffled and distributed to the Draw Piles of two players - the human player and the computer player. These players also have two Played Piles sections where they play their Cards when appropriate.

* The game begins after all of the setup mentioned previously. Players plays a round until the winner of the round is determined. A round starts with each player placing a Card faced up on their Played Piles. The values of the Cards are then compared according to their value. Whichever player has the higher Card wins and collects all Cards on both Played Piles, whether they are facing up or not. If the Cards are the same, then war is declared between the players.

* When war is declared, each player places a total of four Cards. If a player does not have enough Cards to place down (number of Cards left is less than 4) during war, they place however many Cards they can. If the player does not have any Cards (only has one Card, which is on their Played Pile), that last Card will be the Card compared. When placing Cards, every Card other than the last Card is face down, so that the last Card is facing up. The last Card that is facing up in each Played Pile is the Card compared. Whichever player has the higher last Card wins all Cards that are on both Played Piles. If the last Cards have the same value for both players, war is declared yet again.

* One thing to keep in mind is that in this game of war, the Draw Piles of each player are reshuffled every 100 turns, so that the chances of having a draw are much lower.

* There are multiple ways to win the game. The simplest way is to acquire all of the Cards in the game, so that the opponent has 0 cards. If this condition does not meet within 5000 rounds, the winner of the game is the player who has the greater number of Cards in their Draw Piles. If the number of Cards in both Draw Piles are the same, then a Sudden Death match is played. whoever is the winner in that round is the winner of the game.
